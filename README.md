# ELEN0062-1-Introduction-to-machine-learning
Machine learning projects  
-[Project 1](https://github.com/sibced/ELEN0062-1-Introduction-to-machine-learning/tree/main/Project%201) : Classical algorithms. The goal was to get accustomed to the basics of machine learning and concepts such as under- and over-fitting.  
-[Project 2](https://github.com/sibced/ELEN0062-1-Introduction-to-machine-learning/tree/main/Project%202) : Bias and variance analysis. The goal was to better understand the important notions of bias and variance. Received a score of **16/20**.  
-[Project 3](https://github.com/sibced/ELEN0062-1-Introduction-to-machine-learning/tree/main/Project%203) : Next pass prediction in a football match. We were provided with a dataset of 8682 samples (passes) with the player positions, who are the sending and receiving players. From this dataset we derived multiple features and used supervised learning techniques to predict the next player who will receive the ball.  This project was organized as a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/iml2020). My team ranked 13th over 47 teams on the leaderboard and received a score of **16/20**.
