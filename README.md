# ELEN0062-1-Introduction-to-machine-learning
Machine learning projects  
-[Project 1](https://github.com/sibced/ELEN0062-1-Introduction-to-machine-learning/tree/main/Project%201) : Classical algorithms. The goal was to get accustomed to the basics of machine learning and concepts such as under- and over-fitting.  
-[Project 2](https://github.com/sibced/ELEN0062-1-Introduction-to-machine-learning/tree/main/Project%202) : Bias and variance analysis. The goal was to better understand the important notions of bias and variance. Received a score of **16/20**.  
-[Project 3](https://github.com/sibced/ELEN0062-1-Introduction-to-machine-learning/tree/main/Project%203) : Next pass prediction in a football match, using supervised learning algorithms. This project was organized as a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/iml2020). My team ranked 13th over 47 teams on the leaderboard and received a score of **16/20**.
